Submitted by: Robert Balatbat

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

Link to project: Live site: https://memory-game-robjgb.glitch.me/ Code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/memory-game-robjgb

## Required Functionality

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- I used links from https://w3schools.com as a reference to help me with CSS stylization. 
- I used https://boxshadows.nakulrathore.com/ for button hover shadow effects. 
- I also used https://developer.mozilla.org/  for HTML, CSS, and JS documentation as a resource when needed. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- A challenge I encountered while creating this submission would be stylizing the webpage 
in order to give it a more modern look. In the beginning of this project, I had a pretty messy looking
layout when I was trying to tinker with the CSS code. I found myself not remembering every single term that I used in my previous 
experiences. During this process, I found myself searching up a lot of the different terms and declarations by looking up what they would do 
in order to find the specific line I needed to add to accomplish a specific goal. For example, I was not sure how to make things centered and spaced 
out evenly, so I found out that I could use flexbox to alter the layout and evenly space out while justifying the objects in the center. Another issue I had
would be how to properly separate certain styles as well as adding new styles that I never used before. I realized how I needed to edit the HTML
code as well in order to properly edit specific items on the screen. I overcame the challenges I encountered
through trial and error, looking at how things changed when editing the code, and finishing it up once I was satisfied with the result. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- A question I have about web development is how things work in the server side. I do not have much experience with web development, only having done 
a small front end project before, so I am interested in learning how things translate over in terms of the backend, databases, etc. Another question I have would 
be how complex things can get beyond front-end development. I am wondering how long it usually takes web developers to fully finish a website with all the features
in mind. The last question I have would be what process do seasoned/experienced web developers take when developing their websites. I wonder if it is any similar
to how I created this project, with a lot of trial and error, or is it a more planned out process, and if so what advice would they give in order to have a smoother
experience developing. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would probably try to make a new game mode,  
and I would also try to add all the recommended features. In this hypothetical new game mode, I would add power ups
to add more excitement to the game. I would also add more buttons, a challenge such as buttons to avoid, and scoring/round system in order
to track progress. I would also look over the code more in order to make it more neat and efficient.
Another thing I would do would be to experiment with adding assets from sounds to images and using those to improve the visual 
and audio aspects of the game.
